                  the infinite possibilities and many ways in which we can find the inspiration that we need. We have to open our minds up to the ways in which we might find inspiration, in which it might cross our paths, and what types of things that we might be looking
                   for inspiration for. People find inspiration in nature, through technology, through people who we emulate, through random occurrences, and even within ourselves. Here is a list of ways in which we may find inspiration.</p>

Empathy is not feeling sorry for a person, but rather, it incorporates an emotional and psychological understanding of another. Empathy is the ability to deeply understand why a person thinks, feels and behaves the way they do; it is the ability
                  to look through the eyes of another and empathize with their situation and personal context.</p>
